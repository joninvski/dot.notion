- Better (fast) way to cicle windows in WFloatWS instead of unidirectional
  Meta-Tab?

- How to move windows from a framed to an empty workspace using keyboard?

- Make a Lua script to organize windows in an empty workspace.

- Make ksh-like completion for queries (specially filesystem queries).

- When maximizing windows horizontally or vertically only, make other windows
  get their original size when we resize this window back.

- Make statusbar always on top on empty workspaces and maximized windows.

- What about bookmark windows to make go and come back really fast?

- Make a prompt (like F3), but that buffers stdout instead of stderr and show
  the result.

- Let windows that cannot be focused, but go out the view when it is on the
  top of a frame the user wants to edit. Don't know if it is possible to make
  it only with notion, but maybe it is possible to make it with X11
  programming.

- In float windows, F3 shows a prompt on the bottom of the window. That is ok,
  but following this rule strictly, the prompt doesn't appear in the visible
  area if the bottom of the window is not visible in the workspace.

- Workspaces names or numbers? Let's show them in the statusbar?

- Change frame title independently from the application settings.
